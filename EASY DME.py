# Programme Name: EASY DME (Lower-Back Assesment)
# This demo program simplifies DME and health support products for the public by utilizing...
#...a self self diagnostic approach and intuitive systems.
'''
We all know it's best to see a medical or health provider when we encounter health problems. Specifically ones
dealing with the lower back,shoulder and kneck.

Although when most people encounter pain... often times they try to play doctor in lieu of getting evaluated by a
certified provider.

Easy DME supports the user in making the possibly best subjective assesment in regards to the appropriate DME
or health products(i.e - kneck brace, back brace, knee brace..etc) without FIRST visiting a certified provider.

#scoring scale:
'''
1 - light
2 - moderate
3 - mod to severe
4 - severe

With total score of 39 given 11 scored questions
Slighty-Increased risk vs Increased Risk will be ditermined based on the score: Slightly-increased risk <= 19 and highly-increased risk >= 20

Theory:
    given the scoring system, one should be able to accertain a subjective yet qualitative method
    for defining a slightly increased risk disposition to an increased risk condition. Bearing in
    mind the questions asked are constructive and effective in regards to the scoring scale.

    Hence a high accuracy in a self diagnostic method will be the outcome.

Back pain is often caused by overworked muscles and ligaments or wear and tear of the spine and the intervertebral discs. \
There are many reasons for this: a one-sided posture while working, a lack of physical exercise or the wrong movements and emotional stresses in day-to-day life.\n\n\

    slightly_increased_risk = ("\n\nYour assessment is: SLIGHTLY-INCREASED RISK\n\nExplanations about this assessment\n\nThere are many reasons for back pain. It often develops as a result of remaining for long periods in the same position or because of too little exercise or the wrong movements.\
 A sedentary job is often a contributory factor for pain in the back. Psychological stresses in day-to-day life or pressure to perform at work or strife with the partner can have negative effects on the state of your back.\
  The result: your body grows tense, the muscles lose their normal elasticity, grow hard and hurt.\n\n\
  However, you can prevent back pain before it gets a chance develop. Pursue back-friendly sports such as power walking, swimming or cycling. Regular sporting activities strengthen the back muscles and help support the spinal column better.\
  Also make sure you have enough relaxation during the day, for example, with soothing massages, autogenic training and meditation exercises. A healthy diet, particularly in association with obesity, is an important precondition for a healthy back.\n\n\
